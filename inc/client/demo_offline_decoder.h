/*
 * Q2PRO-X 1.5 — offline DM2/MVD2 decoder core (private cursor)
 *
 * This is the re-entrant Seam the Demo Library Module owns.  It walks a demo
 * byte stream with a `sizebuf_t` it allocates itself and emits NEUTRAL events
 * into a caller-supplied sink.  It exists because the two pre-existing demo
 * readers cannot be used off the main thread:
 *
 *   CL_GetDemoInfo()       reads through the process-global `msg_read` and Q2
 *                          VFS handles, and deliberately never parses frames.
 *   MVD_PreScanAnalytics() saves/restores global `msg_read` and global
 *                          `mvd_jmpbuf` — valid only on the calling thread —
 *                          and allocates through the shared zone.
 *
 * Hard contract for everything in demo_offline_decoder.c:
 *
 *   - no `msg_read`, no `mvd_jmpbuf`, no `cl`, `cls`, `sv`, no MVD channel
 *     lists, no renderer, no cvars, no Q2 VFS, no `Com_Printf`/`Com_Error`,
 *     no `Z_Malloc` family;
 *   - input arrives through `dof_reader_t`, which the Module implements with
 *     raw stdio on the worker thread;
 *   - all allocation is one bounded block owned by the job;
 *   - every length, index and count coming out of the file is validated
 *     before it is used for allocation or pointer arithmetic;
 *   - a malformed stream aborts THIS file with a quality flag and never the
 *     process.
 *
 * The protocol primitives themselves are NOT re-implemented here: the decoder
 * calls the shared `MSG_*_From()` entry points in `src/common/msg.c` with its
 * own cursor, so there is exactly one delta-entity / delta-playerstate
 * implementation in the engine and it cannot drift.
