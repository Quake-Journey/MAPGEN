/*
 * MapGenGeometry - the canonical, editable equivalent of a map's compiled
 * geometry, and the carrier of architecture fidelity.
 *
 * This exists because the thing it replaces could not do the job. The previous
 * fidelity path learned a segmentation of the donor - where the rooms are, how
 * big, what connects to what - and rebuilt each room as a fresh axis-aligned
 * box. At fidelity 100 that reproduced q2dm1's volume graph exactly and looked
 * nothing like q2dm1: 904 of the donor's planes are oblique and its average
 * brush has seven sides, while every solid the old path emitted was a box with
 * six. No work downstream could recover geometry the learning stage never
 * read.
 *
 * So the geometry itself is what is carried. A donor's convex solids, their
 * per-side texture mapping with the real S/T axes, which submodel owns what,
 * and the entity records bound to those submodels - all of it survives
 * Training, and a candidate at fidelity 100 IS the donor's geometry rather
 * than a reconstruction of it.
 *
 * What this is NOT: a decompiler. A compiled BSP has lost the original CSG and
 * the editor's grouping, and nothing here pretends otherwise. What it recovers
 * is an EQUIVALENT set of convex half-spaces and surface constraints, which is
 * what a compiler needs and what the eye reads as architecture.
 *
 * Contract sections 3, 6.3 and 14.0.
