/*
 * MapGenPmove - the engine's own player movement, run over a compiled map.
 *
 * Every reachability answer this project has given so far came from a graph it
 * built itself: stances on a 32-unit grid joined by edges it decided were walks
 * or jumps from the numbers. That graph called a ledge a route because a
 * `rise` field said eighteen, and a player who dropped into the pocket below it
 * could not get out. Contract 18.3 was rewritten around that screenshot, and it
 * says the authority is the shared pmove over the compiled BSP - not a model of
 * it, the same code the client and the server run.
 *
 * So this binds `PmoveOld` to a `mapgen_bsp_t`: its trace and pointcontents
 * callbacks go to the reentrant box trace, and everything else - friction,
 * step height, water, the duck, the jump, the wall-slide - is the engine's,
 * unchanged and unmodelled.
 *
 * One caveat is in the ABI and cannot be designed away: `pmove_old_t`'s
 * callbacks take no context, so the bound document lives at file scope and one
 * of these may be bound at a time. It is a Bind/Release pair for that reason,
 * and it is checked rather than assumed.
